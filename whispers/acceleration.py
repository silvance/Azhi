"""Choose the compute device for transcription: CPU, or an NVIDIA GPU if present.

CPU is the supported baseline - every deployed machine has one, results do not
depend on the choice, and nothing here is required for the application to work.
A GPU is an optional speed-up: on a field laptop with a CUDA card, a long
recording finishes in a fraction of the time.

Detection is entirely local. ``ctranslate2.get_cuda_device_count()`` asks the
already-bundled inference library what it can see; it loads no models, contacts
nothing, and returns 0 rather than raising when there is no driver. A build with
CPU-only CTranslate2 wheels simply reports no GPU, which is the truth for that
bundle.

The failure mode that matters is a run that dies half-way because CUDA was
selected on a machine that cannot serve it. So an explicit GPU request is
checked before the run starts and reported in plain language, and
:func:`fallback_to_cpu` gives the caller a CPU device to retry with rather than
losing the job.
