"""Check that an installed bundle is the one the build produced.

A desktop bundle is thousands of files copied onto removable media and carried
to a machine with no network. Copies go wrong: an archive extracts short, a
scanner quarantines a library, a drive returns a bad read. The application then
fails at whichever missing piece it happens to reach first, with a traceback
about that piece rather than about the copy - and the same folder can fail two
different ways on two runs, which is the clearest sign that the files, not the
software, are the problem.

The build records an inventory of every file it shipped, with size and SHA-256.
``Whispers --verify`` re-reads the installed copy and says plainly which files are
missing, truncated or altered. That turns "it crashes differently each time"
into a list.

The inventory is a statement about *this build's own files*. It is not a
security control: anyone who can alter the files can alter the inventory beside
them. It answers "did this copy arrive intact", not "is this copy trustworthy".
