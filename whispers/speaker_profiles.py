"""Versioned speaker (subject) profiles: the reference voices of known people.

This is distinct from :mod:`whispers.profiles`, which stores an *operation* profile
(settings plus the voices met during that operation). A
:class:`SpeakerProfile` is one **subject** - a known person whose reference voice
was deliberately enrolled from historical recordings - and is the thing a
questioned recording gets compared against.

Two properties matter operationally and drive the schema:

* **Provenance.** Every sample records where it came from (file, SHA-256, time
  span, duration, when, how) and the profile records the exact embedding model
  that produced its vectors, including that model file's SHA-256 and vector
  dimension. Embeddings from different models are not comparable, so a profile
  that cannot prove which model produced it must not be silently compared.
* **Trust.** Samples an operator deliberately enrolled from known audio
  (``reference``) are trusted. Samples picked up automatically from transcript
  corrections (``learned``) are not, and stay out of the trusted model until an
  operator approves them - so one mistaken correction cannot quietly shift a
  known subject's reference centroid.

Files are written atomically and save failures are raised, not swallowed: these
are operational records, not conveniences.
