"""Near-live transcription of a stream (RTMP/UDP/HTTP/device/file) via ffmpeg.

faster-whisper is not a streaming recogniser, so this does *chunked* near-live
transcription: ffmpeg reads the incoming stream and splits its audio into short
fixed-length WAV segments; each finished segment is transcribed with
:func:`whispers.transcription.transcribe_audio` and appended. End-to-end latency is
roughly one segment length plus the model's inference time, so a small model
(``base.en`` / ``small.en``) on CPU stays a few seconds behind live.

The engine runs on background threads and reports results through callbacks, so a
GUI can start/stop it and update a transcript as text arrives. It has no GUI or
optional-dependency imports itself.

        Anything ffmpeg can open as input: an ``rtmp://`` / ``udp://`` /
        ``http://`` URL, a device, or a file. For a GoPro pushing RTMP to this PC
        via a local RTMP server, pass that server's URL (e.g.

    model_size
        A bundled model name, a size, or a path to a CTranslate2 model directory
        (same as :func:`whispers.transcription.transcribe_audio`). Prefer a small
        model (``base.en`` / ``small.en``) so CPU inference keeps up.
    listen
        When True, ffmpeg *waits for an incoming connection* (``-listen 1``)
        instead of connecting out - use it when the source pushes directly to a
