"""A build self-test: deployment verification before a bundle leaves for the field.

Bundles are assembled by a CI workflow with several optional pieces (diarizers,
translation packs, OCR), and it's easy to ship one that's missing something. This
answers the questions that decide whether a build is usable for an operation:

    Can this build transcribe?
    Can this build diarize?
    Can this build create speaker profiles?
    Can this build compare voices?
    Which speaker-embedding model does it use, and what is its SHA-256?
    Can it export reports?
    Which decision thresholds are in force, and were any overridden?
    Is every required local asset present?

and summarises them as READY / NOT READY, with the build identity (build id,
version, commit) and the hashes of the bundled models. Whoever hands out a build
runs this *before* it reaches an air-gapped machine.

It only inspects - ``find_spec`` plus cheap filesystem reads (hashing a model is
the one heavier operation, and is done lazily) - and never loads the heavy
libraries or touches the network.
