"""Split an existing transcript by speaker again, with a different count.

Transcription is the expensive half: ninety minutes of poor phone audio is the
better part of an hour of a laptop's life. Working out who spoke when is a
small fraction of that, on audio the model has already been handed.

So when the speaker count comes back wrong - two people reported as five - the
remedy should not be to transcribe the recording a second time. The words were
never in doubt. This dialog asks for the count to try instead, and says plainly
what will be lost: the splitting is redone from the words as transcribed, so
any speaker tags corrected by hand go with it.
