"""Opening a window where the operator is looking.

Tk leaves a new dialog's position to the window manager, which on Windows
means the top-left of the primary display. With the application on a second
monitor the result is a question asked off-screen: the operator sees a window
that has stopped responding and no reason for it, because the reason is on
another screen behind a browser.

Everything here is about that: put the window over the one it came from, raise
it, and make sure it can be answered - or dismissed - without hunting for it.

The arithmetic lives in :mod:`azhi.dialog_placement`, which has no display to
depend on. What is left here is the Tk: asking a window where it is, and
telling another one where to go.

    belongs there and not back on the settings window.

    Which makes ``winfo_toplevel`` the wrong question to ask: the detached
