"""Handing over a folder instead of picking its contents one at a time.

What a case folder actually contains is recordings, notes, photographs, last
run's transcripts, and subfolders by day or by source. So the walk has to
decide what is a recording - and then say what it decided against, because an
operator who drops a folder of 50 and sees 12 queued must not be left
wondering whether the tool lost the rest.
