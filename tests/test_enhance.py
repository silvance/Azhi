"""Noise reduction, and the things it must not be allowed to claim.

An operator asked whether a conversation in a bar can be isolated. The answer
is in whispr/enhance.py and in the numbers behind it: the bundled denoiser is
good against steady noise and useless-to-harmful against a room full of other
voices, which is the case people want it for. What these hold shut is not the
model's behaviour - that is the model's - but the application's claims about
it, and the paths cleaned audio must never reach.

# The first metric tried here was this project's own level-margin figure,
# before and after. On mixtures with known answers it reported +35 dB on hiss
# and +4 dB on babble - where the ground truth says cleaning made the babble
# recording 1.7 dB *worse*. It was measuring how hard the denoiser gated the
# quiet parts, which it always does, not whether speech got clearer. A number
# that says "this helped" about a recording it has just damaged is worse than
# no number, so the report carries facts and no verdict.
