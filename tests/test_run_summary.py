"""What a finished run says, and about which recordings.

Two failures these hold shut, both found by review of live code rather than by
a test that was missing:

* a batch reported only the last file, so a gutted first file finished silently;
* the warning was announced a line before the success banner, which replaced it,
  so the warning reached nobody at all.
