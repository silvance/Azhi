"""Download offline assets (ffmpeg + faster-whisper models) into ``whispr_assets/``.

Run at build time on a connected machine (or in CI) before invoking PyInstaller.
The downloaded assets are bundled into the executable so the target machine never
needs network access.

Usage::

    python packaging/fetch_assets.py ffmpeg
    python packaging/fetch_assets.py models small,medium,turbo

Model names are the ones the application itself offers (see
``whispr.transcription.MODEL_SIZES``); ``turbo`` and ``large-v3`` are ~1.6 GB
each, so a bundle carrying either will exceed a 2 GB GitHub release asset once
anything else is added.

Requires the build extras: ``pip install "silvance-whisper[bundle]"``.
