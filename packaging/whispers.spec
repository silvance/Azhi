#     python packaging/fetch_assets.py models small,medium,large-v3
#     python packaging/fetch_assets.py diarization
#     pyinstaller --noconfirm packaging/whispers.spec
#
# Build (pyannote diarizer, best quality on hard audio; adds CPU PyTorch):
#     pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#     pip install "whispers[gui,bundle,pyannote]"

#
# Optional text translation (offline Argos Translate):
#     pip install "whispers[gui,bundle,translate]"
#     python packaging/fetch_assets.py argos ar,ru,zh,fa,uk,he,ko
#     (plus the steps above, then pyinstaller)

# have it reviewed before distributing a bundle that carries it):
#     python packaging/fetch_assets.py nemotron
#     (plus the steps above, then pyinstaller)

# The spec auto-detects whether pyannote.audio / argostranslate / pytesseract are
# installed: it bundles the PyTorch stack + offline pyannote cache, the Argos
# stack + language packs, and/or the OCR stack (Tesseract + tessdata) accordingly;
# otherwise it builds the lighter sherpa-onnx-only bundle and excludes torch.
# python-docx (Word export), langdetect (auto-detect) and tkinterdnd2 (drag-and-
# drop) are bundled when present too.
#
# The resulting dist/Whispers/ folder is fully self-contained (Python runtime, all
# dependencies, the ffmpeg binary, and the Whisper + diarization models) and can be
# copied to an air-gapped machine and run with no network access.
