"""Hold a bundle's dependency versions to the ones that were tested.

The build manifest records what a build *was*. This decides what a build *may
be*: ``packaging/lockfile.txt`` pins every dependency whose version can change
how the application behaves, and this script fails the build when what is
installed does not match it.

Without it the release workflow installs ranges - ``ctranslate2>=4.8,<5`` and
the like - so rebuilding the same commit in six months can produce software
that was never field-tested, with nothing to say so. An air-gapped operational
build is exactly the case where that matters: the bundle on the removable media
is the only copy anyone will ever run.

Usage::

    python packaging/check_lock.py              # verify; non-zero on drift
    python packaging/check_lock.py --write      # re-pin to what is installed

``--write`` is how a dependency update happens: run it on a branch, read the
diff, test the bundle it produces, then merge. An update nobody chose is the
thing this exists to prevent; an update somebody chose is one commit.
