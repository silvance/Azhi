"""Speaker comparison and open-set identification against known-subject profiles.

Two operations sit here, both deliberately conservative:

* **1:1 comparison** - one questioned speaker against one known subject's
  reference profile. Produces a similarity *score*, a qualitative band, the
  thresholds and durations behind it, and the quality of both sides.
* **Gallery search** - one questioned speaker against every known subject. Ranks
  them, but applies the same acceptance-and-margin rule before calling anything a
  lead, so a "best" match is not automatically an identification.

Three rules run through all of it:

* A cosine similarity is **not** a probability of identity. Nothing here reports
  a percentage, a confidence of identity, or a likelihood that two recordings
  contain the same person.
* Insufficient or poor audio outranks a good-looking number: with too little
  usable speech the assessment is ``Insufficient data``, whatever the score.
* Vectors from different embedding models are not comparable, so a comparison is
  refused outright unless the models match (or the operator explicitly accepts an
  unverifiable legacy profile).
