"""Save and reload a transcript as a small JSON "project" sidecar.

Transcription/diarization is expensive and the manual speaker corrections are
hand work, so this lets an operator close the app and resume editing later: the
full result (segments, words, confidences), the speaker name mapping and the
source media path are written to a ``.sotto.json`` file and read back.

Schema 2 adds a **provenance** block (see :mod:`sotto.provenance`): the source
recording's SHA-256, the models and settings that produced the analysis, and the
application build. Schema 1 files still load - they simply carry no provenance,
which is reported as unknown rather than invented. The source media itself is
never copied into the project.
