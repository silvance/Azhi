"""Measure a questioned speaker from a recording, and record what was measured.

A comparison is only as honest as its account of the audio behind it. Two things
this module exists to keep straight:

**The embedding must represent the speech the result claims.** An earlier
version embedded the single longest usable stretch but reported the voiced
duration of *everything* selected, so a speaker with 24 seconds spread over many
short turns could be measured from 2 seconds of audio and still clear a
minimum-duration check written to prevent exactly that. Here the selection is
split into windows, every usable window is embedded, the embeddings are
averaged, and the duration reported is the speech of the windows that actually
went into the average - the same construction the reference side uses, so the
two are comparable.

**The questioned recording identifies itself.** The result carries the source
file's name, size and SHA-256, the operator's selection, and the exact spans
embedded, so a report describes the recording that was compared rather than
whatever happened to be open in another tab.

Local only: it reads audio, hashes a file and runs the bundled embedder.
