"""Turning "here is a folder" into "here are the recordings in it".

An operator with a case folder wants to hand over the folder, not pick its
contents out of a file dialog one at a time. What they hand over is rarely
only recordings: there are notes, photographs, a spreadsheet, the transcripts
from the last run, and usually subfolders - by day, by source, by target.

So this walks it and decides what is a recording, and it says what it passed
over rather than quietly shortening the list. A folder of 50 that arrives as a
queue of 12 has to explain itself, because the other 38 are either irrelevant
or the whole point, and only the operator knows which.

Two rules are worth stating plainly:

* A file the operator named themselves is taken at its word. Extensions are a
  guess about content, and someone who points at a specific file knows more
  about it than the guess does. Only the contents of a *folder* are filtered.
* Nothing here follows a symlink out of the folder it was given. A recording
  the operator did not put there is not in scope, and a loop would walk
  forever.

Kept out of the GUI so the walking and the wording can be tested without a
display.
