"""Entry point for Whispers: the GUI, or a headless self-test.

The GUI itself lives in :mod:`whispr.gui`; this is the thin front door that
``whispr.app:main`` names, so the console script, ``python -m whispr`` and the
PyInstaller bundle entry (``packaging/whispr_entry.py``) all go through one
place.

It deliberately does **not** import the GUI at module level. ``--self-test``
has to work on a machine with no display and has to keep working when the
window toolkit is exactly what is broken - a build missing Tk should report
that, not crash on the way to saying it.
