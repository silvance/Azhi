"""Give a panel its own window, and take it back again.

A transcript is a document. Reading one in a box at the foot of a page of
settings is the wrong shape for the work: an analyst wants it filling a screen
- often the second screen, next to the case file or the map - while the
settings that produced it stay where they are.

Tk can do this without rebuilding the panel or keeping two copies of it in
step. ``wm manage`` takes a frame out of its parent's layout and hands it to
the window manager as a real, resizable, maximisable window; ``wm forget``
gives it back. The widgets inside never move, so state, scroll position,
selection and bindings all survive the trip in both directions.

Those two calls have no tkinter wrapper for an arbitrary frame, hence this
module: the Tcl underneath, plus the bookkeeping that makes a popped panel
behave like a window somebody can close.
