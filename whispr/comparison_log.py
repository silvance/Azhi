"""A durable record of every speaker comparison this copy has run.

A comparison is an investigative act about a named person, so the fact that it
happened is part of the record - not just the answer it gave. Without this, the
only trace of a comparison is whatever the operator happened to export before
running the next one, and a question asked six weeks later ("what did we
actually run against this subject, and what came back?") has no answer.

What is kept is the *account* of a comparison: which subject, which recording
(by name and SHA-256), which speech was selected, the score, the band, the
thresholds in force, the audio quality on both sides and any warnings. What is
never kept here is the evidence itself - no audio, no transcript, and no
embeddings. A voice embedding is the sensitive artefact in this system; a log of
activity should not become a second copy of it.

Records are individual files, written atomically and never rewritten, so an
entry cannot be lost or truncated by a later write. They are read back
newest-first and an unreadable one is skipped rather than taken as an empty log.

The bands and wording here are the same investigative ones used everywhere else:
a similarity score with a stated threshold, never a percentage, a probability of
identity, or a claim that two recordings are the same person.
