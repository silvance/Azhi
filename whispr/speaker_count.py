"""How many people are on the recording: the choice, and what it means.

Diarization can work the speaker count out for itself, and on clean audio it
usually does. On a long, poor-quality call it can be badly wrong in a way that
costs hours: a ninety-minute two-handed phone call came back split across five
speakers, and the only way to correct it was to run the whole recording again
with the count set.

So the count is no longer an advanced setting left at its default. The operator
answers a question before the run starts - a number, or "not sure" - and either
answer is fine. What is not fine is the question never being asked.

The vocabulary lives here rather than in the GUI so it can be tested without a
display, and so a stored setting and a dropdown label can never drift apart.
