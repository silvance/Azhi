"""Operator-facing analysis report: what was analysed, by what, and what it means.

Produces a hand-off document covering the case/source information (including the
source recording's SHA-256), the transcript, every speaker comparison performed,
and a prominent statement of what a similarity result does and does not
establish.

The *content* is assembled as plain sections by :func:`build_report_sections`,
which needs no optional dependency and is unit-tested; :func:`write_docx` renders
those sections through python-docx. Keeping them apart means the wording - which
is the part that matters for how a result is read - is verified by tests even
where python-docx is not installed.
